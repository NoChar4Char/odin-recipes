    <h2>Grilled Cheese is a delicious, hot cheese sandwich typically prepared by heating slices of cheese between slices of bread.</h2>
    <p>This recipe calls for sliced Cheddar, which is a wonderfully crowd-pleasing cheese. You can use sharp Cheddar, mild Cheddar, or a blend of both. Another classic choice is plain ol' sliced American cheese â€“ it tastes nostalgic and gives you a gorgeous cheese pull.</p>
